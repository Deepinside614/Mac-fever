# Denial of Service Code (codename:MACFEVER)

This repository contains a Python script designed to demonstrate a denial of service (DoS) vulnerability in macOS file handling by rapidly consuming desktop space. The script generates a large file and copies it multiple times. **This code is intended for research and educational purposes only.**

## Description

The script generates a large file and copies it multiple times. This can lead to rapid disk space consumption and potentially cause system instability.

## Usage

- `write_large_file`: Generates a large file with random binary data.
- `multiply`: Copies the generated file multiple times.
